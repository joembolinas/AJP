This outline will help structure the documentation for identifying requirements and specifications, including guide questions for each section.

### Outline

1. **Objectives**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     1. **What are the primary goals of the project?**

        - to build simple github pages for Academic `journey Portfolio` for TERM 3 and scalable for future term

     2. **How do these goals align with stakeholder needs?**

        - developing raw content from various directory/repository and structured it into base design of web
        - the web is structured by per sections, and per sections has components, these components is interface to diplay the content of structuredly
        - structured content is using chronological order, per skills, per project, using card or any element to diplay the components on the components
        - each components has clickable for more information about the content or expand the content
        - scalable for future development, suplly content per term
     3. **What success criteria will be used to measure achievement?**

        - succesfully deploy a github page that display academic content
        - scalable, can add conent or update every end of term from any repository
2. **Project Scope**

   - **In Scope**:

       - easy add content coming from various repository each term
       - can see or expand to see more details of each content element
       - developing raw content and structured it into base design of web
     - **What deliverables are expected?**
       - phase 1 - 5
       - phase 1 - docs
       - phase 2 - structure
       - phase 3 - config, setup, prompt, extraction of content from Term 3
       - phase 4
       - phase 5
   - **Out of Scope**:
     - **What features and functionalities are explicitly excluded?**
       - UI, design,
     - **Are there any limitations or boundaries defined?**
       - as long as not use UI like html. css (to revise if needed)
3. **Stakeholders**

5. **Assumptions**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     - What assumptions are being made about the project environment?
     - How might these assumptions impact project outcomes?
6. **Risks**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     - What potential risks could affect the project?
     - How will these risks be identified, assessed, and mitigated?
7. **Functional Requirements**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     - What specific functionalities must the system provide?
     - How will these functionalities be validated?
8. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     - What performance, security, and usability standards must be met?
     - How will these requirements be measured?
9. **Use Cases**

   - **Guide Questions**:
     - What are the primary use cases for the system?
     - How will users interact with the system in each use case?
10. **Diagrams and Flowcharts**

    - **Needed Diagrams**:
      - Use case diagrams to illustrate user interactions.
      - Flowcharts to depict processes and workflows.
      - Entity-relationship diagrams for data modeling.
