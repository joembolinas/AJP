# ACADEMIC JOURNEY PORTFOLIO

I WANT TO BUILD SIMPLE WEBPAGE `ACADEMIC JOURNEY PORTFOLIO`

> **An academic journey portfolio is  a collection of a student's work that documents their learning, skills, and growth over time=. It can include academic projects, reflections, and extracurricular activities to showcase progress, achievements, and personal development to others, such as teachers, admissions committees, or future employers. These portfolios can be physical or digital and help the student reflect on their own learning process, while also serving as a tool for self-assessment and goal setting.**
