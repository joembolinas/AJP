why i create markdown 1st?

before i start to the actual project i want to stablish initial toughts how i start on this workspacerepository or codebase

before i generate `1-create-readme.prompt` i hava draft of the readme
i write on my own

after i create markdown

---

since i have the initial context on README

it easy to improve the document neeeded for on going process of this project

can able to help me the copilot to improve my gaps and other areas that need development.
