why i create markdown 1st?

before i start to the actual project i want to stablish initial toughts how i start on this workspacerepository or codebase

before i generate `1-create-readme.prompt` i hava draft of the readme
i write on my own

after i create markdown

---

since i have the initial context on README

it easy to improve the document neeeded for on going process of this project

can able to help me the copilot to improve my gaps and other areas that need development.

---

i applied AGENTS.md the `docs/` folder , These files guide the AI Copilot to automatically update the reference files whenever changes are detected.


NOTE:


now i confirm the specs-arch is done for and honestly in  the future theres a chance a to revised this base on the situation

### Create Project Specification Document

> **📝 What is this?**
> A specification document (often called "spec") is a detailed description of what our project will do. It covers features, requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

> **🎯 Why is this important?**
>
> - Acts as a "contract" for what were building
> - Prevents misunderstandings about requirements
> - Helps identify missing requirements early
> - Provides clear acceptance criteria

> **⏰ When i do this?**
> As the first documentation step after project initialization.

### Break Down into Epics (Product Perspective)

> **📝 What is this?**
> An "epic" is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller pieces. Think of it as a major feature or capability of your system.  Breaking your project into epics makes it manageable.

> **🎯 Why is this important?**
>
> - Makes large projects less overwhelming
> - Helps prioritize what to build first
> - Enables parallel work streams
> - Provides natural milestones for progress tracking

> **⏰ When to do this?**
> After completing your specification document.

> **👤 Perspective:**
> This prompt approaches epics from a **Product Manager's** viewpoint - focusing on user value and business outcomes rather than technical implementation.

 Architecture & Design

> **📝 What is this phase?**
> This is where you design the technical foundation of your project. You'll make decisions about architecture patterns, technology choices, and project organization that will guide all development.

> **🎯 Why is this important?**
>
> - Wrong architectural decisions are expensive to fix later
> - Good architecture enables scalability and maintainability
> - Provides a shared technical vision for the team
> - Reduces decision-making during implementation

> **⚠️ Important Note:**
> Architecture decisions should be made thoughtfully but not obsessed over. It's okay to start simple and evolve.  The goal is "good enough" architecture that can grow with your needs.

> **⏰ When to do this?**
> After planning is complete, before writing any application code. This phase typically takes 1-2 days for a medium project.

 Architecture Blueprint

> **📝 What is this? **
> An architecture blueprint is a high-level view of how your system will be structured - what components exist, how they interact, and how data flows through the system.

> **🎯 Why is this important? **
>
> - Visualizes the entire system at a glance
> - Identifies integration points and APIs
> - Reveals potential bottlenecks
> - Guides team on where code belongs

> **⏰ When to do this?**
> As the first step of the architecture phase.
