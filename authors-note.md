why i create markdown 1st?

before i start to the actual project i want to stablish initial toughts how i start on this workspacerepository or codebase

before i generate `1-create-readme.prompt` i hava draft of the readme
i write on my own

after i create markdown

---

since i have the initial context on README

it easy to improve the document neeeded for on going process of this project

can able to help me the copilot to improve my gaps and other areas that need development.

---

i applied AGENTS.md the `spec/` folder , These files guide the AI Copilot to automatically update the reference files whenever changes are detected.

TODO: ai agents to help development of this project

NOTE:

TODO  : AI TOOLKIT I NEED
[ ] GIT BRANCH STRATEGIES

now i confirm the specs-arch is done for and honestly in  the future theres a chance a to revised this base on the situation



### Create Project Specification Document

> **📝 What is this?**
> A specification document (often called "spec") is a detailed description of what our project will do. It covers features, requirements, constraints, and success criteria.

> **🎯 Why is this important?**
>
> - Acts as a "contract" for what were building
> - Prevents misunderstandings about requirements
> - Helps identify missing requirements early
> - Provides clear acceptance criteria

> **⏰ When i do this?**
> As the first documentation step after project initialization.
